    "# Identifing and Plotting Candidate Statistical Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "In this program, we will be qualitatively identifying  relationships between in game performance and the statistics that represent the game. A trivial example would be \"how does third down conversion rate correlate with the point spread in the game.\" Obviously, teams with a higher conversion percentage will be able to score more points because their drives will be longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, when comparing teams that consistently perform well in key statistics, and comparing them to teams who, to put it bluntly, underperform, we will be able to predict the resulting point spread. In other words, this program is qualitatively assessing the correlation between statistics and success, to later be used in the machine learning algorithm."
